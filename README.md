# Rosie's Dream

One night, during one of Rosie's epsilon sleep, she dreamt of a way she could practice for math exams by randomly selecting problems.
Low and behold, her dream came true!

## Tech "Stack"

This project is written in pure JavaScript and a single library called KaTeX.js for client-side math rendering.
All the application logic is written in the file `main.js`.
It is important to note that KaTeX has some differences from vanilla LaTeX.
It does not include package management and only supports math mode.
A list of supported functions can be found [here](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).

**Note.** I strongly prefer using `\( ... \)` and `\[ ... \]` to enter inline math mode and display math mode rather than `$ ... $` and `$$ ... $$`, respectively.
However, you can use either one to enter math mode.

## Contribution

If you want to add or change a problem, edit the corresponding file in the `questions/` folder and do a pull request.
The structure of the `.tex` files looks like this

```
\begin{problem}
Prove that blue is the best primary color.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
\begin{enumerate}[a]
\item
Prove that yellow not a good color.
\item
Prove that red is a terrible color.
\item
Prove that black is a color.
\item
Prove that "color" is the correct spelling.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
```

If you want to add macros, you can edit the `macros.js` file which looks like this

```
const r = String.raw; // raw string tag for convenient LateX/KaTeX

const macros = {
  "\\N": r`\mathbb N`,
  "\\Z": r`\mathbb Z`,
  "\\R": r`\mathbb R`,
  "\\Q": r`\mathbb Q`,
  "\\E": r`\mathbb E`,
  "\\F": r`\mathbb F`,
  "\\Aut": r`\operatorname{Aut}`,
  "\\Inn": r`\operatorname{Inn}`,
  "\\Sym": r`\operatorname{Sym}`,
  "\\inv": r`^{-1}`,
  "\\surject": r`\twoheadrightarrow`,
  "\\inject": r`\hookrightarrow`,
  "\\isom": r`\cong`,
  "\\ep": r`\varepsilon`,
  "\\subset": r`\subseteq`,
  "\\set": r`\left \{ #1 \right \}`,
  "\\abs": r`\left \lvert #1 \right \rvert`,
  "\\given": r`\; | \;`,
  "\\of": r`\circ`,
  "\\ideal": r`\triangleleft`
};
```

and simply add a new entry for each additional macro.

Importantly, outside of math mode, no LaTeX commands work aside from `\begin{problem}`, `\end{problem}`, `\begin{enumerate}[<type>]`, `\item`, and `\end{enumerate}`.
These are merely there to make it easier to paste from existing `.tex` assignment files. Each question is expected to be surrounded by `\begin{problem}` and `\end{problem}`.
For multiple part questions, there is the `\begin{enumerate}[<type>] ... \end{enumerate}` "environment".
It expects a single argument, either "1" or "a", depending on how you want to label the question.
At the moment, it does not support nested enumeration, so that is another thing you can contribute.

If you wish to add a new course, you need to add an entry to the `topics.json` file, which looks like this

```
[
  {
    "name": "Algebra 4",
    "nickname": "Rosie's Dream",
    "filename": "algebra4.tex"
  },
  {
    "name": "Analysis 4",
    "nickname": "Rosies's Nightmare",
    "filename": "analysis4.tex"
  },
  {
    "name": "Advanced Calculus",
    "nickname": "Rosie's Hell",
    "filename": "advancedCalculus.tex"
  }
]
```

Then add a new `.tex` file in the `questions/` folder.

Please preview your changes before doing a pull request.
You can preview by doing

```
cd rosies-dream
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

and heading to `localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Issues

If you already used this site before and it does not work anymore, erase all site data.
This is due to the fact that arrays rather than dictionaries are used for the Local Storage.
As mentioned, another issue is that nested enumerations are not yet supported.
